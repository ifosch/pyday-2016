Si us sembla que valoro baix, ""as usual meetups"" és molt alt! Sempre us ho dic, estem molt mal acostumats amb el nivell de PyBCN!
I a quin idioma prefereixo, he posat català per posar algo: no hi havia l'opció de ""Qualsevol dels 3"".

Al meetup XXL, al refrigeri posterior, la beguda estava molt bé, però vaig trobar a faltar menjar una mica més contundent (pizzes?) a part dels snacks.

Els workshops, els vaig trobar justos de temps que a sobre es van afegir els problemes de xarxa i amb el de Serverless i MongoDB no vam poder fer res. Els de MongoDB van fer un pla B (mostrar demo i ho van salvar bastant).
Estaria bé, per futurs esdeveniments, insistir als speakers que diguin quin software i quina versió de Python (sí, és trist preguntar-ho però hi ha qui encara utilitza el Python 2.7) i quins paquets. Informant als assistents uns quants dies abans per poder-s'ho preparar. Bàsicament, que el workshop comenci amb tots els assistents tenint l'entorn perfectament configurat d'entrada.
Per cert, em va anar bé el litre i mig de cafè que em vaig emportar al recollir... :D:D
